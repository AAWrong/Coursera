					 This was a design project at "conceptual design" level, which means many decision made were general without too much details. However, at the end of this project, some detailed decision were also made. Recall<a href="philosophy.html"> Aaron's design philosophy</a>, high-level design requires fewer design cycles. Hence, for this project, there was one big complete cycle for high-level design, a few small cycles for detailed decisions.

			<h5> Requirement Framing: </h5>
			<p id="p202">
				<Br/>
					 The original information delivery system at Allan Garden was signs written biside plants. However, most people complains about the signs due to the following reasons: 
					 <Br/>
					 <ul id="l1">
					 	<li>		Not every plants had a sign aised, because there wasn't enough space.</li>
					 	<li>		Signs were small, which didn't have enough information for people who wanted to learn about plants.</li>
					 	<li>		Signs were placed in between plants. Visitos are often confused which plants were those signs for.</li>
					    <li>		Many signs were not written in English. (Not sure why) </li>
					 </ul>
					 <Br/>
			</p>

			<img id="pic2" src="sign.jpg" height="400" width="1000"></img>
			<p id="p203">
				<Br/>
					This design projects had 2 key clients (stakeholders), school classes (including schoool kids and teachers) who frequently went there for class activities and staff at Allan Garden who might potentially be responsible for implementing and maintaining the proposed solution. Notably, the stakeholders above were prioritized among other stakeholders (for example, other visitors at allan garden) because one, school kids account for a large amount of visitor population at Allan Garden; two, school kids were required to learn the plants, they had high interest in the design; three staff were the ones that had the power to approve the design, they had high influence in the project.      
					 
			</p>

			<p id="p204">
					 Based on the problem of current information dilivery system and identification of stakeholders, following were the design requirements:   
					 <Br/>
					 <ul id="l1">
					 	<li>		Maximize the amount of info provided for each plants, where amount was measured as number of alphabets of human minimal readable font size that could be fitted into information block which depicted the plants</li>
					 	<li>		Minimize time needed for visitors to access the information delivery system assuming they were standing at the main entrance.</li>
					    <li>		Minimize time needed for visitors to locate information within the information delivery system. </li>
					    <li>		Minimize the frontal area (taken from the plane parallel to walking path) of any physical parts of the information delivery system, so that the information delivery system did not block the path at Allan Garden.    </li>
					    <li>		Minimize the frontal area (taken from the plane perpendicular to walking path) of any physical parts of the information delivery system, so that the information delivery system did not block visitor looking at plants.    </li>
					    <li>		Minimize the cost of implementing and maintaining the proposed solution.    </li>
					    <li>		Makesure the proposed design didn't destroy the Conservatoryâ€™s Victorian-era theme at Allan Garden.  </li>
					 </ul>
			</p>

			<p id="p205">
					 Notably, the above requirements did not come all at one time. Many of these requirements came from RFP (request for proposal) we were given for this project. However, after idea generation and decision making using given requirements in RFP, we found that some requirements given were irrelevent. So, we pushed back to requirements framing stage. In the original RFP, relavency of the information provided is a key requirements. However, in this project, we focused on the information delivery system instead of the information itself. Hence, we changed the requirements to maximization of amount of information instead of maximization of relavency of information. Secondly, the original RFP required the design helping staff interact with visitos. However, we found that this interaction feature was very hard to be integrated into the information delivery system, after idea generation stage. Plus, according to client consultation, many people preferred in-human interaction with staff at Allan Garden instead of using some sort of system. Staff also have extra time to talk to people beside their work. Therefore, we eliminated the requirement.

			<h5> Idea Generation: </h5>
			<p id="p206">
				<Br/>
					 Morph chart were largely used for idea generation of this project. Below is a sample morph chart we used. Briefly, the created ideas are 
					 	<Br/> 
					  <ul id="l1">
					 	<li>		Place a encyclopaedia about plants in Allan Garden.</li>
					 	<li>		Handout booklets that introduce plants to visitors. (SELECTED solution) </li>
					    <li>		Make an app that introduce plants. </li>
					    <li>		Make a website page that introduces plants    </li>
					    <li>		Make a cube that has different plant's information on each of its side. Hang the cube from ceiling. </li>
					    <li>		Post a poster that introduces plants    </li>
					 </ul>

			<h5> Idea Evaluation & Decision Making: </h5>
			<p id="p207">
				<Br/>
					 One of the mistake we made for this project was taht we didn't do through a rigirous idea evaluation and decision making process. Instead, idea are evaluated and selected based on instinction. Briefly, the booklet design was chosen because all other alternatives had some "flaws", judged by insticntion. For example, access to the encyclopedia from main entrance might take long, (because there would only be one of them). App would be costly to implement and maintain. Webpage would require a server that would also be costly to implement and maintain. Cube and poster would have large frontal area that either would block the path or would impede visitors looking at plants.
