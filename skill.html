			<span>I am a self-taught programmer.</span> I did take programming courses at school, but my enthusiasm made me explore much more than what are covered in my program. Now I have become a "multi-lingual" programmer. I have learned more than 10 different kinds of programming languages, which made me well capable of reading manual pages and picking up new languages or libraries quickly. In the field of Software and Computer Science, I have basic knowledge of or some experience in:

			Besides software, <span>I also have a well-rounded engineering foundation.</span> Thanks to my program. I have had experiences or knowledge in many different engineering and science disciplines. Not only did this multi-disciplinary study experiences make me much informed, I have also become confident to keep exploring new fields. In addition, I am pursuing an engineering business certificate, which made me go even further and start thinking about engineering in real-life market.

			Moreover, <span>I am a rigorous learner</span>. Thanks to my program again. I learned many theories and first-principle derivation in addition to formula and applications, which made my learning much more substantial.
