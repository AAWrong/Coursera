					  This is a simple steam engine I made for my basic machining course at George Brown College. I learnt to use lathe, milling machine and drilling machine to process the metal. The processing required high precision. There was one component that needed to be thinned to fit into the other components. I was really careful, but I still got the component thinned too much. In face, I made that component three times before finally got one that worked.

					  The steam engine had a flaw that was not very obvious. The flaw was due to incorrect using of milling machine. In principle, I had to mill the metal layer by layer. However, I was rushed that I want to mill down a thick layer (or I chuck) out of the metal. Consequentially, the milling machine didn't have enough strength to clamp the metal when I tried to cut a truck out of it. The metal tilted which was dangerous.

					  One last tip, never touch a metal that has just been processed. I have tried it and it is extremely hot!
